This is all the base images / source images for the game.  They were created with the GIMP (the .xcfs)
and should be edited with the GIMP.

If you must edit the images, make sure that they maintain their dimensions, or update their dimensions
in the DEF statements so that the game doesn't break.  I know, I could read these when I'm loading the
images so that you don't have to change them manually, but meh.

Also, so that you don't break the game, you'll want to edit these in Paint :(  I know...it's painful,
but this game was meant to run in DOS (ugh), and since you have Windows, Paint is the easiest way to
export the images to be 128 _color_ bitmaps.
